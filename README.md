# Malware-Analysis-Challenge
This repo is a Malware Analysis Scenario wrote by me.
The scenario suitable for blue investigation teams, and designed to run on a Windows environment.
You can take these file, change them as you like, custom them for your investigative environment and start the challenge!
The scenario is built from three files:

## Fake_Installation.exe
This shellcode download 2 more file logo.png and Win.exe, and eventually run Win.exe

You can add the file shellcode.txt as a new section in some legit instaletion file and change
the execution flow (to be more reliable), or you can just run it as is.

I will upload the shellcode file soon!

## Win.exe
The purpose of this file is to extract shellcode from the image logo.png and inject it into the notepad.exe process.

### some Anti-Forensics features included:
#### Anti-Debugging
