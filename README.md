# Malware-Analysis-Challenge
This repo is a Malware Analysis Scenario wrote by me.
The scenario suitable for blue investigation teams, and designed to run on a Windows environment.
You can take these file, change them as you like, custom them for your investigative environment and start the challenge!
The scenario is built from three files:

## Fake_Installation.exe
This file is a legit known software installetion file (you can choose any file you want)
you need to add the file shellcode.txt as a new section in your selected instaletion file

this shellcode download 2 more file logo.png and Win.exe, and eventually run Win.exe

## Win.exe
The purpose of this file is to extract shellcode from the image logo.png and inject it into the notepad.exe process.
